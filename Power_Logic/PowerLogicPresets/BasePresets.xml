				<WaitMode>False</WaitMode><!--Starting Wait Mode, values can be True or False. if true, actions will run if no signal received.  Default is False -->				
				<ID>-1</ID><!--this value is normally randomly generated, if set to negative will also cause a new random number to be generated,
											however certain actions can referenced this value, so it can be set to a specific value if required (e.g. DoorProfileAddTo)
											valid values are any positive integer-->
				<Actions><!--Actions List (Required)-->
				<!--All Actions require a valid Ref, Depending on the action depends what Data fields do
					TimeInfo is by default 60 ticks, this value can not be lower than 20 ticks (third of a second), only DoorDelay allows TimeInfo to be changed in game
						
					DoorAddOpenAction: This action opens the door
					DoorAddCloseAction: This action opens the door
					DoorFlickOff: This action flicks power off, effectively disabling the door
					DoorForbid: This action Forbids the door, good for preventing access without disabling the door
					DoorUnForbid: This action Forbids the door
					DoorChannelSwitch: switches the doors channel.  Data1 - values can be Primary (default) or Secondary, Data2 - this value is the channel you want to change to
					DoorWaitMode: controls whether to do actions when receiving a signal or when not receiving, Data1 default is false (run when receiving)
					DoorProfileAddTo: allows you to add a profile to primary or secondary channel, Data1 - possible values Primary, Secondary. Data2 - ID of profile to modify
					DoorProfileSubFrom: Like DoorProfileAddTo but removes the profile from Primary or Secondary channel
					DoorSetPriority: Changes the priority of a profile.  Data1 can be between 1(high) and 5(low), Data2 is ID of profile
					DoorDelay: Adds a delay before the execution of the next action, changing TimeInfo affects the length of the delay
					
					TimeInfo, Data1 and Data2 fields are optional and will use default values when omitted.
